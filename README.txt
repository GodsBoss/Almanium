Almanium Mod
============

This is a simple MineCraft mod adding a metal, "Almanium", and its respective ore, blocks, tools, armors, etc. Almanium is more or less like iron, the pickaxe is the same tier, armor has comparabe stats, and so on.

The name is derived from the word "Alman", which is a term used Germans in Turkey and North Africa. Its origin is "allemand", used by the French. So basically, this is Germanium, but it is called Almanium.

Main motivation for making this mod was learning to make a mod without resorting to tools like MCreator, so this is basically another "This is my custom ore and metal" mod.
